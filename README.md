# Mydrobe
Mydrobe is an app designed to help lower the time spent choosing what to wear in the mornings. Users can upload their individual clothing items and look at 
them side byside before they even get out of bed.  They will then be able to grab exactly what they need from their closet instead of searching for the perfect fit.
